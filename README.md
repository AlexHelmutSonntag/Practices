# Distributed Systems B.Sc. classes

## Welcome :)

This is the course of Distributed Systems for the Autumn semester of the 2017/2018 academic year.

### How things work here...
* Everything here is made for **educational purposes**;
* Anyone is very much welcome to send pull requests;
  * Only students of this course will get **extra points** tho...
* Pull requests will be evaluated by the lecturer (and it may (or may not) take a while)
* Pull requests with unnecessary files or misleading documentation will be commented and may be refused.

## What if I am a student of the course?
Even better, let's remember some stuff then...

### Course rules
* Presence is mandatory, remember to sign the presence sheet every class. If you fail on doing so, 3 unjustified absences automatically fails you.
  * **But I was traveling** Good for you :) But unless you have some justification that is just another absence;
  * **But I was sick** Send a proof of it to the lecturer e-mail;
  * **But I really needed to skip the class** Send your justification to the lecturer's e-mail and the course team will evaluate it, we are not so cold hearted.
  * **But I arrived super late in the semester** Once again, send it to the lecturer, this information will be verified with the university administration and the course team will decide case by case.
  * **But I was about to sign the presence sheet then I got distracted by a gnome that was passing by the classroom, passed the sheet on and forgot to sign it by the end of the class even though it was there all the time.** Really? OMG! Fortunately you have 3 absences.


* **IDEs** are not always allowed, for assignments they are allowed **if and only if** there is an appropriate documentation with the projects. The IDE's supported are Netbeans and Eclipse. Projects that can be compiled and executed by command line are very much appreciated practice.

### Copies, plagiarism and similars
Any sort of plagiarism, copies, ideological falsehood  or unlawful behavior may be subject of auction in the format of the university regulations.

#### Course grades
* Challenges and class exercises (10%)
* Final assignment (40%)
* Exam (50%)

* Accepted pull requests can count as extra points in all the activities with grades, being that these points will never compose more than 30% of the grade.
  * The extra points will first be attributed to the challenges, then to the final assignment and only if all those are with full mark, to the final exam.

* During the exam period, the highest grade is taken
* There is no *cum laude* grade
