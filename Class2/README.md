# Finally getting even more distributed :)

Our work today is gonna be based in the exercise made in this website [http://www.progressivejava.net/2012/11/How-to-make-a-Tic-Tac-Toe-game-in-Java.html](http://www.progressivejava.net/2012/11/How-to-make-a-Tic-Tac-Toe-game-in-Java.html)

We want to develop a Tic-Tac-Toe game server, where, two client machines will connect to it and then start playing.

Your task is to distribute the work with two players following the given rules:
* The current board can be shown in the Server
* The client requests should be sent by the Client machines (one for Tic one for Tac)

Useful:
* [Java Socket](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/net/Socket.html)
* [Java ServerSocket ](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/net/ServerSocket.html)
